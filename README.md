# veritone-sdk

this is a monorepo managed by Yarn's workspaces feature (https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/).
# Documentation
Heavily WIP docs/examples for the various packages are available at https://veritone.github.io/veritone-sdk

# Development
1. if you don't have `yarn`, install it here: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
2. `yarn install` in the veritone-sdk root.
3. run `yarn buildall` from the veritone-sdk root. This will bundle all the packages so that cross-dependencies can resolve correctly.

# Releasing
_This is WIP and may change as we find a better process_

1. Complete your feature and PR it to the master branch.
2. Once merged, update `package.json` in each affected folder under the `packages` directory
    * Increment the version field using [semver](http://semver.org/)
3. Update each package's `CHANGELOG` file with your new version.
4. Commit the `package.json` and `CHANGELOG` changes (only!) to master.
5. [Tag the commit as a release](https://github.com/veritone/veritone-sdk/releases). Create a release for _each_ package you updated, using the naming scheme:
    * Tag version: version-packagename, ie. `1.0.0-veritone-client-js`
    * Release title: packagename vVersion, ie. veritone-client-js v1.0.0
6. On your local machine, checkout the `master` branch and `git pull`.
7. Run `npm publish` in each package directory as needed to push your release to NPM.
